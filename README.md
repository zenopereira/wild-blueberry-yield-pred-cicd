***Description***:The dataset used for predictive modelling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program, that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agro-ecosystem. The simulation model has been validated by the field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA and Canadian Maritimes during the last 30 years and now is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. This simulated data provides researchers who have actual data collected from field observation and those who wants to experiment the potential of machine learning algorithms response to real data and computer simulation modelling generated data as input for crop yield prediction models.

***Problem Statement***: The target feature is yield which is a continuous variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 17 features step-by-step by going through each day's task. The evaluation metrics will be RMSE score

***Steps to solve this problem statement are:***

***Exploratory Data Analysis***  - It is the first step of understanding your data and acquiring domain knowledge. It helps in knowing the real features apart. Perform EDA using the following resources and note down your insights with most visualizations that you perform.

***Preprocessing*** -  It is an very important step as it is useful in handling missing values, handling skewed data, understanding different types of plots, using Z-score and IQR etc.

***Feature selection*** - The method of choosing the important parameters of our data is called Feature Selection. Feature Selection is the method of reducing the input variable to your model by using only relevant data and getting rid of noise in data.

***Modelling*** - A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.

***Hyperparameter Tuning*** - Hyperparameter tuning is an essential part of controlling the behavior of a machine learning model. If we don’t correctly tune our hyperparameters, our estimated model parameters produce suboptimal results, as they don’t minimize the loss function. This means our model makes more errors. In practice, key indicators like the accuracy or the confusion matrix will be worse.

***Deployment*** - So we would be using streamlit framework. Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps and after that we would be deploying that on the heroku cloud platform using Git
